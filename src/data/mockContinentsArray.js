    bio:
      "Africa straddles the equator which bestows a rich diversity of wildlife and landscapes on the world's second largest continent. Large predators roam the sweeping savannas among huge herds of grazing herbivores, while apes, monkeys and snakes inhabit its dark, dense forests. Widely regarded as the place where human life originated, Africa is home to many of the world's best loved and most fascinating animals, as well as to some of its most endangered. Yet it's also home to many species that are as familiar to us in the UK as they are to Africans.",

    name: 'Antarctica / Arctic',
    bio: `Antarctica holds the record for being the coldest place on Earth, which together with extensive ice cover and lack of winter sunlight makes the continent pretty inhospitable to life. The sea, rather than the land, is what supports most creatures such as penguins and seals. It's often warmer than the land, so is a good place to retreat to and warm up to a balmy -2 Celsius. Permanently land-living plants and animals in Antarctica are small and ground-hugging to avoid wind chill and the accompanying dehydration.
  The Arctic ice cap first formed some three million years ago, providing a new habitat - polar pack ice - for mammals and birds to exploit. Seals and polar bears are now the primary inhabitants of this sea ice. The bears travel over it and the seals under, meeting at the seals\' breathing holes, to the detriment of the seals! On land, plants tough enough to survive the Arctic cold form the habitat known as tundra. Because of the harsh climate and prolonged darkness, many animals migrate away from the dark Arctic for the winter, returning to take advantage of the 24 hour summer sunshine to breed.`,
