  'intro-2': 'This site puts a face to those animals with the greatest need, in hope that their plight resonates with someone somewhere. When you have time to unplug and breath fresh air, remember that Earth isn\'t your planet or my planet, but...',

During research, it was evident that most information available online about endangered animals was well represented, but tucked away and hidden.
