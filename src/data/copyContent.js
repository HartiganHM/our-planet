  'intro-1': 'Our Planet is a student lead initiative meant to bring awareness to endangered animals across the world through detailed facts and beautiful photographs. While most strive to be aware of other people in need, it is less frequent that we pay mind to the other species that cohabitate this world with us.',
  'intro-2': 'This site puts a face to those animals with the greatest need, in hope that their plight resonates with someone somewhere. When you have time to unplug and breath fresh air, remember that Earth isn\'t your planet or my planet, but...',
  purpose: 'Our Planet is a web application constructed through the study of front-end engineering at Turing School of Software & Design. During research, it was evident that most information available online about endangered animals was well represented, but tucked away and hidden. Our Planet makes use of a wealth of stunning photos in order to resonate with users in a more immediate way. It is our hope that you walk away with a greater awareness of the impact we have, as humans, to the other species that call this planet home.',
  why: 'It is widely believed that climate change is one of the biggest issues facing our generation. While this problem is of the utmost importance for future generations, it is of immediate concern to nearly every animal on this planet. Loss of natural habitats, pollution, and unsustainable use of resources are at the top of the list of human-created problems that impact more than our own cities and towns. With animals unable to speak for themselves, it is important to be mindful not of only how we impact future inhabitants on Earth, but those that currently live here.',
  help: 'The smallest efforts can have an enormous impact when done on a large scale. Recycling and composting help towards renewability, while eating more consciously with organic foods or reducing consumption of animal products can bolster sustainability. Even buying clothes or furniture that have a longer lifespan supports a more conscious way of using materials. To help animals in a more direct way, visit our Charities page to learn more about organizations leading the way toward a planet teeming with a diversity of life.'
